What is an NFT-based Subscriptions (EIP-5643)?

NFT-based Subscriptions that require users or participants to hold a specific NFT. By verifying their ownership of the required NFT, users can access particular services, benefits, rewards, etc. As such, this means that there are many different options for this sort of Subscription. For instance, it can give users access to a specific online club, DAO, Discord group, or a special event. In the case of the latter, we tend to talk about NFT ticketing, especially if itâ€™s a one-time thing. Furthermore, in most of these cases, the NFT owners can access certain NFT-gated websites. There they can often view unlockable content.

Subscription NFTs allow businesses to build communities of their most loyal customers. Customers are already familiar with the benefits of the Subscriptions model. Look for the ways to reward your Subscriptions NFT holders with exclusive perks, access and content.
