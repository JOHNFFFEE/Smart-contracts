ERC-4907, allows an NFT owner to permit another individual to use their NFT for a designated period of time. After that time ends, the user no longer has access to the NFT.


The Dual Role NFT Rental Standard (ERC-4907)
ERC-4907 adds a new role to the NFT standard, dividing who is the owner and who is the user of the NFT — making it possible to “rent”. The tenant can use the NFT till the loan term ends, automatically passing the NFT back to its owner.

The ERC-4907 standard is an extension of ERC-721 that introduces the dual roles of ‘owner’ and ‘user’ at its application layer. ERC-4907 streamlines NFT rentals through an automated ‘expires’ function which enforces the time-limited role of the user. This innovative feature makes NFTs rentable by default; owners no longer have to manually withdraw user rights, eliminating a tedious process and another on-chain transaction.
