# ROYALITIES
 
using OpenZeppelin Iplementation


## A few parameters to take in consideration

 *
 * Royalty information can be specified globally for all token ids via {_setDefaultRoyalty}, and/or individually for
 * specific token ids via {_setTokenRoyalty}. The latter takes precedence over the first.
 *
 * Royalty is specified as a fraction of sale price. {_feeDenominator} is overridable but defaults to 10000, meaning the
 * fee is specified in basis points by default.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: ERC-2981 only specifies a way to signal royalty information and does not enforce its payment. See
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981#optional-royalty-payments[Rationale] in the EIP. Marketplaces are expected to
 * voluntarily pay royalties together with sales, but note that this standard is not yet widely supported.
