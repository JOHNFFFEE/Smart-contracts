## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **Game/** 🎮  
  *Description:* Contains smart contracts designed for blockchain-based gaming applications.

- **NFT/** 🖼️  
  *Description:* Contracts implementing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) adhering to the ERC-721 standard.

- **Tokenomics/** 💰  
  *Description:* Smart contracts for token economics, including ERC-20 token implementations.

- **Utils/** 🛠️  
  *Description:* Utility contracts and helper libraries to support other smart contracts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To start working with the smart contracts in this repository, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:JOHNFFFEE/Smart-contracts.git
cd Smart-contracts ```

### 2. Open in Remix or Truffle  

#### Option 1: Remix IDE  
Open the desired `.sol` files in [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) for a browser-based development environment. Simply upload the contract files to Remix, compile, and deploy them to the desired network.  

#### Option 2: Local Development with Truffle


## 📝 Usage Examples  

### Deploying an ERC-20 Token  

1. Navigate to the `Tokenomics/` directory.  
2. Open the ERC-20 token contract (e.g., `YourToken.sol`) in Remix or your preferred IDE.  
3. Compile and deploy the contract to your desired Ethereum network.  
4. Use the following functions to interact with the token:  
   - **`transfer`**: Send tokens to another address.  
   - **`approve`**: Approve a spender to use your tokens.  
   - **`balanceOf`**: Check the token balance of a specific address.  

### Minting an NFT  

1. Navigate to the `NFT/` directory.  
2. Open the NFT contract (e.g., `YourNFT.sol`).  
3. Compile and deploy the contract to the Ethereum network using Remix or another IDE.  
4. Use the **`mint`** function to create new NFTs, providing:  
   - The recipient's wallet address.  
   - The metadata URI for the NFT.  

> *Note:* Replace `YourToken.sol` and `YourNFT.sol` with the actual filenames of your contracts.
